sudo apt install -y git libssl-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt install -y libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
Install librealsense: Clone the librealsense GitHub repository and build it from source:
git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git
cd librealsense
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=true -DBUILD_GRAPHICAL_EXAMPLES=true
make -j4
sudo make install

Post-Installation Steps:
Configure udev Rules: Set up udev rules to allow non-root users to access the Intel RealSense camera:

sudo cp ../config/99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
Reboot: Reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply all changes:
sudo reboot

Testing the Camera:
After the installation and setup, test the camera to ensure it's working properly:
Run RealSense Viewer: Launch the RealSense Viewer from the terminal to test the camera:
realsense-viewer
Experiment with Examples: Explore the examples directory in the librealsense repository for sample code and applications. 

Troubleshooting
If the camera is not detected, ensure it's connected to a USB 3.0 port.
For issues during the build process, double-check the installed dependencies and consult the librealsense GitHub issues page for similar problems.
